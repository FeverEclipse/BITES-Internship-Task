When the air expands because of the heat, the molecules are driven apart, and there is a lower weight of air per cubic foot than there is when the air is cool. As a result, the wing can't extract as much energy from the same airflow and requires higher speeds to get the same effects. The engine, which essentially is an air compressor, can't find enough air to gulp down, so the fuel/air ratio is too rich for efficient combustion and you have to lean it out. The result is that the engine is turning out less horsepower - and it is trying to put that energy into the slipstream through a propeller whose efficiency also is compromised by the higher temperatures.
